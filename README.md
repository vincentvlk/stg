Subnetting Tests Generator - stg

stg is a simple CLI Subnetting Tests Generator for networking students and professionals.

WARNING: I'am just a hobby programmer with mediocre programming skills, so the source code is pretty terrible ;-)

Any usage, modifications and improvements are welcome!

Have a nice day and enjoy!
