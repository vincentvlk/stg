##Subnetting Tests Generator - stg

Hello Friends!

**stg** is a simple & interactive *CLI* Subnetting Tests Generator written in C programming language. This software is targeted towards networking students and professionals to increase and train their subnetting skills.

__WARNING__: I'am just a **hobby programmer** with **mediocre** programming skills, so the source code is **pretty terrible** ;-)

At this time, only **Windows** platform and **Slovak** language is supported. I'am working on GNU/Linux port.

Any usage, modifications and improvements are welcome!

Have a nice day and enjoy!
